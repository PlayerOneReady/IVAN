				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the Community Air Monitoring Network?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The Community Air Monitoring Network is a network of 40 air monitors located throughout Imperial County.  As of September 2016, all but 7 of these monitors have been installed.  These monitors measure current levels of particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5 and PM10).  The air quality measurements are displayed on this website.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This network was developed in response to the community residentsâ€™ concerns about air quality and their desire for more neighborhood-level data.  The network was designed with significant input and decision-making from community residents, while incorporating technical priorities to ensure scientific integrity.  To our knowledge, it is the first community-designed network of its size in the world.  </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How is your network different from government networks?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Air monitors operated by regulatory government agencies are used to measure air quality to see if pollution levels meet federal and state air quality standards.  There are currently 5 government monitors in Imperial County used for regulation. </p>
					<br>
					<p>Our network measures air quality at additional locations throughout the county.  Our monitors are different from government monitors and cannot be used to assess if air pollution levels are within legal limits.  But they provide other important information.  For example, community members can find out current air quality at a specific location and see recommended actions to protect health.  Air quality data from our monitors can also be used for research and to inform activities aimed at improving health and the environment for Imperial County communities.  Learn more about how data from our monitors differ from government monitoring data.</p>
				</div>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How were community members engaged in setting up this network?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Our network has had strong community engagement throughout its development. Comite Civico del Valle (CCV), a community-based organization with over 30 years of service in Imperial County, is a leading partner in developing and maintaining the network.</p>
					<br>
					<p>To ensure that the network was responsive to community needs, all activities are guided by a Community Steering Committee of community leaders and concerned residents from Imperial County.  Additionally, community residents from over 11 cities and towns throughout the county participated in a two-day process to identify and prioritize where to place the air monitors.  Finally, CCV staff received technical training to install, operate, and conduct maintenance on the monitors.</p>
				</div> 
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who is responsible for this network?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The network was developed through a partnership between Comite Civico del Valle (CCV), the California Environmental Health Tracking Program (CEHTP), and University of Washington School of Public Health (UW).  After the original funding ends in early 2018, the network will be continue to operate under the stewardship of CCV, with CEHTP and UW participating in associated research activities.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who funded this network?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The network was developed through a 4-year project (from 2013-2017) funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, grant number 5R01ES022722-03.  Learn more about the project.  Find out how you can support the continuation of this effort.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How is the Community Air Monitoring Network related to IVAN?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>IVAN (Identifying Violations Affecting Neighborhoods) is an environmental justice monitoring and reporting network that currently operates in seven California communities.  The community air monitoring network is an initiative of IVAN, meaning that any community in the IVAN network can leverage infrastructure developed for the IVAN Imperial air monitoring site to display air monitoring data, should they wish to initiate their own community air monitoring network.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I find air quality information on this website?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This website provides different ways to quickly view current air quality at each monitor, as well as ways to view more detailed data.  Explore this brief tutorial to learn more.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>About the Data</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What kind of air quality data can I get here?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The main purpose of the website is to provide the current Community Air-Quality Level (CAL) at each monitor location within the community air monitoring network.  The CAL is an estimate of the particulate matter air quality at that location and is linked to health recommendations.  The CAL reported for each monitor is updated every 5 minutes to reflect current conditions.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Each monitor has a detailed data webpage that provides more information about what air quality is usually like at that location.  For example, for each location, you can see the average air quality for the past 24 hours, past 30 days, and past 90 days.  Air quality data are provided as CALs and as particulate matter (PM) concentrations.  The data on this website are automatically reported from the monitors and have not been verified or validated, so should be considered preliminary and used with discretion.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are these data validated?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The monitors have undergone validity checks under both lab and field conditions, and our network has quality control checks in place.  Additionally, the monitors used by our network perform well in comparison to government monitors and in laboratory studies.  However, the data on this website have not been additionally verified or validated.  Therefore, the data should be considered preliminary and used with discretion.</p>
				</div>
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What can I do with this information?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Data from the community air monitoring network as provided on this website can be used in a variety of ways, including:</p>
						<p>&#8226 Find out the current air quality at one of the many monitor locations<p>
						<p>&#8226 Take action as needed to reduce air pollution exposure for yourself and your loved ones</p>
						<p>&#8226 Examine how particulate matter (PM) air pollution varies within the county</p>
					<br>
					<p>Data from the Community Air Monitoring Network cannot be used to determine if air quality standards are being met. Only data from government regulatory monitors can be used to determine if air quality standards are being met.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What does it mean if the data are different from government data?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The air monitors used for the community network are different from those used by the government for air quality regulation and measure particulate matter (PM) pollution differently.  While our monitors have been shown to perform very similarly to government monitors when located next to each other, they will not produce the exact same measurements.  Government regulatory monitors are considered to be the most reliable, yet their very high cost and large size make their use in a community air monitoring network unfeasible.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Aside from differences between the monitors themselves, there are a number of other reasons that data from the community network may differ from the government regulatory network, such as:</p>
						<p>&#8226 Air quality can vary within short distances, so data from the larger number of community monitors may measure and show these differences better than the relatively few government monitors.<p>
						<p>&#8226 Government monitors may measure other air pollutants besides PM, such as ozone, which may influence the overall air quality levels reported for these monitors.  The community monitors used in Imperial only measure PM.</p>
						<p>&#8226 While we do our best to ensure that the community monitors are functioning, from time to time a community monitor may require maintenance or stop reporting data.</p>
						<p>&#8226 Our network reports data as Community Air-Quality Levels (CALs), which are slightly different from the Air Quality Index (AQI) reported by government monitors.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We recommend that users of our community network also look at the regional air quality reported by the government network.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are Community Air-Quality Levels (CALs)?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Community Air-Quality Levels (CALs) are used to describe air quality in terms of how harmful the level of particulate matter (PM) pollution in the air is to human health.  The CALs are calculated for each monitor based on hourly concentrations, with the number and category updated on this website every 5 minutes.  There are 4 CAL categories, each with an associated color and health recommendation.  The CALs uses the same 4-color scheme as school flag programs within Imperial County.</p>
